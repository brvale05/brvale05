## Hi there, I'm Bruno ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science student at UFES (Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo). Throughout my studies, I've cultivated a solid foundation in programming and sharpened my developer skills. While I'm currently focused on Java, my deepest expertise lies in the C language. As a developer, I want to delve deeper into the topics of: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Neural Networks.
